# BittrexPriceDisplay
This will be a web page that displays the current data of different Coins form Bittrex
The goal of this project is to expand my knowledge of Web design and python development.

Deprecated - Python GUI that grabs the price of a coin from Bittrex and displays it.

Getting Started
=

This is a simple program to show the current price of a coin on bittrex.

CoinPrice.py takes in one argument which is the name of the coin to see the price of:
ex. OMG, XRP, ETH...

BittrexGUI.py is the actual GUI that displays the price and continually updates every 5 minutes until the program is closed.

Ideas
=

Show value of wallet using a config file to keep info private

Show list of highest volume

Show 24hr plot

Show top changers within 10% of 24hr high

Send alerts via email or text

Allow for trading, possibly with the use of an algo

Future Development
=
Instead of creating a GUI, create a webpage
to learn React, Django, SQL and other technologies.
